This project consists in the digitalization of a board game using the java language, previously introduced in the course of _Ingegneria del Software_ (Software Engineering).

## Download

Check out the [latest release](https://github.com/Gab-San/ing-sw-2024-Panceri-Ruzza-Santandrea-Villa/releases/latest) and download the files (preferably all in the same folder).

## Usage

**Navigate** to the folder where you downloaded your **files** and follow the instructions:

> Warning: the `Server.jar` and `FatJar.jar` have to be run with different commands! For correct compatibility, stick with either `Server.jar <-> Client.jar` configuration or `FatJar.jar` configuration

### How to launch the Server

#### `Server.jar <-> Client.jar` configuration

Run the command: 

`java -jar Server.jar <RMI port> <TCP port> [Server IP]` 

(the **order** of the arguments is **important**)

> The IP can be omitted: the app will list the local machine IPs and prompt the user to select one of them (other than `localhost`)

#### `FarJar.jar` configuration

Run:

`java -cp Server.jar it.polimi.ingsw.network.Server <RMI port> <TCP port> [Server IP]`

### How to launch the Client

#### `Server.jar <-> Client.jar` configuration

Run the command:

`java -jar Client.jar <Server port> <RMI | TCP> [Server IP] [myIP=<Client IP>]` 

(arguments can be in **any** order).

- The IPs are optional: if omitted, localhost will be used;
- The `myIP=<IP>` argument is also optional, as it is only used by RMI. It must be an IP reachable by the server.

#### `FatJar.jar` configuration

Replace `Client.jar` with `FatJar.jar` in the command right aboveüëÜ:

`java -jar FatJar.jar <Server port> <RMI | TCP> [Server IP] [myIP=<Client IP>]`

### Notes (on both Client and Server)

Please note that compiling the project using Maven creates a FatJar.

- The IP arguments can be hostnames instead of IP addresses (a.b.c.d)
- All arguments other than IPs/Hostnames are validated on launch and the app will quit if an argument is invalid.
- If the IP/Hostname argument is invalid, the app will instead list all available IPs on the local machine and prompt the user to input a valid IP address.
- If a machine only has one IP (other than localhost) then that IP will be used automatically.

### Navigate the application

The first thing that should appear when looking should be a message that asks which kind of UI to use.

![first_screen](./other/images/manual/first_screen.png)

The options are:

- [TUI](#tui)
- [GUI](#gui)

#### TUI

The TUI (Text User Interface) is an interactive terminal that lets the user control the program through a set of commands.

The command syntax is the following:

`command value|other value|<player_id>`

- **command** is the command keyword (it is always the first word). Commands are listed belowüëá;
- `<description>` indicates a command argument ;
- `value` indicates an argument that must be the given value;
- `value|<description>|other value` indicates multiple alternatives for that argument (only use one);

A list of TUI commands:

| Command | Description |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| help | list all available commands |
| view | change screen to view other play areas or the main board |
| place | play one of the cards into your hand |
| draw | draw a card from the specified deck |
| flip | filp one of your cards upside down |
| move | **on play area view** move your view in the specified direction |
| send | send a message to another player |

More information about TUI commands in the [MANUAL](./other/manual.md).

##### TUI notes

The TUI uses ANSI color codes. They should show correctly on Mac/Linux consoles, but they are disabled on Windows CMD by default.

You can enable them by following the instruction below:

1. Press `Win+R`
2. Type `regedit` and press enter or click on ok
3. Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console`
4. Check if the `VirtualTerminalLevel` value is present:
    - **If _not_ present** then right-click on the `Console` directory and press `New -> DWORD` to add it with value `1`
    - Otherwise change its value to `1`

#### GUI

The GUI (Graphical User Interface) is what you'll be more accustomed since most of modern applications usually have one.

When prompted as the first screen, insert a nickname and press enter to attempt connecting to the server.

![gui_choose_nickname](./other/images/manual/gui_choose_nickname.png)

After this screen if you are the first player to connect you will be prompted to select the number of players in the lobby:

![gui_set_players](./other/images/manual/gui_set_players.png)

If ever in doubt check the [MANUAL](./other/manual.md)
