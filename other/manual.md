## Cards

### Resource cards

A resource card is composed of:

<img src="./images/manual/rc_front.png" alt="Resource Card Front" width="207,75px" height="139px" align="right"/>

- up to 3 visible corners;
- up to 1 resource per corner;
- (**optionally**) points on placement.

### Gold cards

A gold card is composed of:

<img src="./images/manual/gc_front.png" alt="Gold Card Front" width="207,75px" height="139px" align="right"/>

- up to 3 visible corners;
- up to 1 resource per corner;
- points on placement;
- placement requirements.

#### Special points per placement

There are two special ways to score points on placement:

- score _n_ points for each visible corner covered when placing the card  <img src="./images/manual/sp_covered_corners.png" alt="covered corners" width="70px" height="30px"/>
- score _n_ point for each visible item of the specified kind (e.g. in this image case it's the quills) <img src="./images/manual/sp_item_count.png" alt="item count" width="70px" height="30px"/>

### Objective cards

In a similar fashion, objective cards can show two different kinds of goals that define how to count the points scored:

<img src="./images/manual/obj_pattern.png" alt="obj pattern" width="70px" height="108px" align="right">
<img src="./images/manual/obj_item_count.png" alt="obj item count" width="70px" height="108px" align="right">

- score _n_ points for each _x_ visible items on the play area;
- score _n_ points for each time the pattern is uniquely applicable to the play area.

When counting items/patterns, **already counted** items/cards can be considered only once and the highest possible score will be considered!

### Notes about TUI

In the current TUI representation the cards items are represented as follows:

- Wolfs -> W;
- Mushrooms -> M;
- Butterflies -> B;
- Leafs -> L;
- Quills -> Q;
- Scrolls -> S;
- Potions -> P.

For the cards the representation follows the background colour:

- Purple -> P;
- Red -> R;
- Blue -> B;
- Green -> G;

Patterns are usually represented as a matrix on top of the objective card. For example:

<img src="./images/manual/obj_pattern.png" alt="obj pattern" width="70px" height="108px" align="right">

```java
 2
**B
*B*
B**
```
